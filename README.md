# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

This project involves building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to process and analyze text data. The pipeline will include tasks such as tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis. The project will utilize libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers to implement these tasks, providing a robust framework for understanding and analyzing textual information.

<br/>

## Features

- __Tokenization__: Split text into individual tokens or words.
- __Named Entity Recognition (NER)__: Identify and classify named entities in the text, such as persons, organizations, and locations.
- __Sentiment Analysis__: Determine the sentiment expressed in the text (positive, negative, or neutral).
- __Library Support__: Use popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for efficient implementation.
- __Pipeline Integration__: Integrate various NLP tasks into a cohesive processing pipeline.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Text Preprocessing__: Functions to clean and preprocess text data, including removing stop words and punctuation.
- __Tokenization__: Functions to tokenize text using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
- __NER Implementation__: Implement named entity recognition using pre-trained models from SpaCy or Hugging Face Transformers.
- __Sentiment Analysis__: Functions to perform sentiment analysis using models from Hugging Face Transformers or NLTK.
- __Pipeline Orchestration__: Scripts to integrate all NLP tasks into a seamless pipeline.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Text Preprocessing__: Develop functions to clean and preprocess the text data, removing unwanted characters and stop words.
- __Tokenization__: Implement tokenization using NLTK or SpaCy, converting text into tokens.
- __Named Entity Recognition__: Use SpaCy or Hugging Face Transformers to perform NER, extracting entities from the text.
- __Sentiment Analysis__: Implement sentiment analysis using pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers or NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- __Pipeline Orchestration__: Create scripts to integrate all the NLP tasks into a single pipeline, ensuring smooth data flow and processing.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual NLP functions (tokenization, NER, sentiment analysis) to ensure they produce correct results.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the complete NLP pipeline to ensure all tasks work together correctly and efficiently.
- __Performance Testing__: Measure the performance of the NLP pipeline to ensure it can handle large volumes of text data.
- __Accuracy Testing__: Evaluate the accuracy of the NER and sentiment analysis models using annotated datasets.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Text Tokenization__: Tokenize a sample text document and verify the tokens.
- __Named Entity Recognition__: Run NER on a document and identify entities like names, locations, and organizations.
- __Sentiment Analysis__: Analyze the sentiment of a set of customer reviews to determine the overall sentiment distribution.
- __Pipeline Execution__: Process a batch of news articles through the complete NLP pipeline and generate a report summarizing the entities and sentiments detected.
